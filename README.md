*DESCRIPTION*:The objective was to choose a popular mobile app and redesign its UI/UX to address a specific pain point.
Deliverable: A redesigned prototype with detailed explanations of the improvements.

For this project, I chose the PVR Cinemas mobile application, which in its earlier versions was known to have poor navigation and a confusing seat selection process. Users had to go through multiple unnecessary steps, the back button behavior was inconsistent, and the seat layout lacked clarity and responsiveness. These pain points led to a frustrating user experience and provided a strong foundation for redesign opportunities.

To address these issues, I redesigned the UI/UX of a movie booking app, focusing on creating a more intuitive flow, modern visuals, and an overall smoother user journey.

Visual Design Improvements: 
I adopted a vibrant and jazzy color palette to create a lively, modern interface that feels exciting and immersive.
High-contrast elements and visually appealing typography were used to improve readability and draw user attention to key actions.

Simplified Booking Flow: 
The redesigned flow eliminates unnecessary screens. Users can now complete the booking in just a few intuitive steps.

Enhanced Seat Selection Experience: 
Seat selection has been made more intuitive with clearly visible seats.
Selected seats are visually highlighted, and the seating layout is touch-friendly and responsive.
Once the user selects their seat, it will show the date, time, seat number and total cost clearly with a prominent Buy button allows them to proceed directly to ticket confirmation.

Personalized Ticket Designs: 
Users can choose from three different ticket designs, each inspired by popular movie characters. This adds a playful and personal touch to the post-booking experience.

Improved Navigation and Prototyping: 
Back buttons have been consistently placed throughout the design, allowing users to easily return to previous screens without losing progress.
All major icons and logos have been used in the prototype to ensure seamless transitions from one screen to another, making the prototype interactive and true to a real app experience.

How the application works:
The redesigned movie booking app offers a smooth and engaging user experience from start to finish. Upon opening the app, users can scroll horizontally through categorized sections like "Now Playing," "Coming Soon," and "Top Movies," while also scrolling vertically to explore more such sections. After selecting a movie, users choose their preferred theater, followed by a single screen where they can pick the date and time of the show. The next step is seat selection, where available seats are clearly visible and easy to select. Users can view their chosen seat numbers and proceed by tapping the “Buy” button. Once booked, the app displays a visually designed ticket, and users can even choose from three unique ticket styles themed around popular movie characters. The app also includes consistent back navigation and smooth screen transitions through interactive prototyping elements like logos and icons.
